Twili Paste Intellisense extends the development experience of Twilio Paste by giving Visual Studio Code users additional functionality such as hover.

## About Paste

Paste is a design system used to build accessible, cohesive, and high-quality customer experiences at Twilio. Paste supports Product Designers and Engineers with tooling and assets that help them build customer UIs in Figma and React.

>Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. \nâ€” Salesforce UX, [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)


Tokens are named for their use case, rather than their value. For example `$color-background-error` is named to indicate the appropriate background color for an error, as opposed to `$color-background-red` which is less specific and could be used in a number of ways depending on cultural context and design language. This makes their intended use clear and intentional, and allows us to develop a scalable and consistent visual language.

In Paste, 1 rem unit = 16 pixels.
